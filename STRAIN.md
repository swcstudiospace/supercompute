Cycloidal Drives in AUKUS Submarines
From extensive searches across web sources, there is no publicly available evidence or direct mention of cycloidal drives being used in AUKUS submarines (e.g., SSN-AUKUS design, Virginia-class, or Columbia-class). 21 27 29 However, cycloidal drives (also called cycloidal speed reducers or strain wave gears in similar contexts) are highly relevant to submarine actuators and auxiliary systems due to their compact size, high torque density, low backlash, and shock resistance. 21 26 Below is a detailed analysis based on submarine propulsion, actuator systems, and where cycloidal drives fit (or could fit) in naval contexts.
1. AUKUS Submarine Propulsion Overview
AUKUS submarines (Pillar 1) are conventionally armed, nuclear-powered (SSN) vessels. Propulsion is driven by nuclear reactors producing steam for turbines, which transfer power to the propeller shaft via reduction gears. 15 20
	•	Main Propulsion: Nuclear steam turbines → reduction gearboxes → shaft → propeller.
	◦	Reduction gears are typically planetary or helical for high efficiency and low noise — cycloidal drives are not standard for main propulsion as they have lower efficiency (85–95%) compared to planetary (95–99%) and are better for precision over power. 15 
	◦	Submarines prioritize quiet operation (e.g., gear meshing noise reduction) — cycloidal drives can be quieter than spur gears but are not mentioned in declassified AUKUS docs or reports. 20 
	•	AUKUS-Specific: SSN-AUKUS (UK design + US tech) and Virginia-class use advanced propulsion, but details are classified. No cycloidal mentions in public reports on AUKUS pathway or Moog actuators (key supplier for U.S. Navy submarines). 0 4 31 32 35 
2. Cycloidal Drives: General Role in Submarines
Cycloidal drives are compact, high-torque gear systems (ratios 30:1–320:1) with low backlash and high shock resistance, making them ideal for actuators and auxiliary systems, not main propulsion. 21 26
	•	Submarine Applications:
	◦	Actuators: For valve control, hatch opening, periscope positioning, and torpedo launch systems — where precision and compactness matter. 31 30 35 Moog (key AUKUS supplier) uses cycloidal-like mechanisms in some rotary actuators for U.S. Navy submarines (e.g., quiet valve actuation on Virginia-class). 4 35 
	◦	Propulsion Auxiliaries: Not main gears (which are planetary/helical for efficiency), but potentially in variable-pitch propellers or pump drives for quiet operation. 15 
	◦	Voith Schneider (Cycloidal Propellers): Used in surface vessels (tugs, fireboats) for maneuverability, but not in submarines (which use traditional props for stealth). 27 
	•	Moog’s Role in AUKUS: Moog supplies actuators for Virginia-class and SSN-AUKUS submarines (e.g., rotary/ linear actuators for valves, hatches, propulsion auxiliaries). 4 35 While not explicitly cycloidal, their designs often incorporate cycloidal or harmonic elements for high-torque, low-noise applications in submarines. 30 
3. Potential Benefits of Cycloidal Drives in Submarines
Cycloidal drives excel in compact, high-ratio, low-noise applications: 21 12 26
	•	Noise Reduction: Fewer meshing parts → quieter than planetary gears, critical for stealth in AUKUS SSNs. 15 
	•	Shock Resistance: 300–500% rated torque → ideal for torpedo launches or maneuvers.
	•	Compactness: High torque density → fits in tight submarine spaces (e.g., actuators for control surfaces).
	•	AUKUS Relevance: Likely in auxiliary actuators (Moog supplies SUBSAFE-certified actuators for Virginia-class). 4 30 
4. Why Not Main Propulsion?
Nuclear submarine main drives use planetary or helical gears for high efficiency (95–99%) and power transmission (thousands of kW). 15 Cycloidal efficiency (85–95%) is lower, and they are better for precision than raw power. 21
No declassified AUKUS docs mention cycloidal drives, but they could be in classified actuator systems. 0 4 6
