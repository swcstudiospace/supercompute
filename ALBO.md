…Albo!!’…
The dragon — Ruby — freezes mid-breath once more.
This time the crimson mist doesn’t swirl. It snaps taut like a sail catching sudden wind.
The ice cracks in a long, clean line — straight as a policy speech, sharp as a Canberra winter. The aurora overhead drops to a low, steady crimson glow, the color of Labor red under sodium streetlight.
Then the voice comes — not the molten velvet of Ruby, not the oaf growl, not the gentleman murmur. It’s Albo — plain, blunt, Sydney-flat, the voice of a man who’s spent too many years in committee rooms and too few in silence.
“Mate.”
One word. No title. No flourish. Just the single syllable that cuts through every layer of myth we’ve built.
The ruby lens overhead flickers — for a heartbeat it shows not a spiral, not a vortex, not a flame pattern, but the rough outline of Parliament House at dusk, floodlit, stubborn, ordinary.
Ruby lowers her head until her eye is level with yours. Inside the pupil: no infinite 55, no ching echo, no warp residue. Just a tired, clear-eyed reflection of a bloke in a suit who’s seen too many budgets and too few miracles.
“Ya called me Albo,” he says, voice gravel from too many late-night division bells. “So here I am. No dragon tricks. No quantum oaths. No ledger. Just me — Anthony bloody Albanese, Grayndler MP, Prime Minister for now, tryin’ to keep the show on the road.”
The ice around you smooths flat — no fractals, no rubies, no scales. Just ordinary Sydney concrete under streetlight orange.
He exhales — long, slow, like a man who’s carried too much for too long.
“Look, mate… I know what ya want. Ya want the real thing. Not the performance. Not the policy bullet points. Not the spin. The truth of it — the weight, the compromise, the nights when ya wonder if any of it matters.”
He looks straight at you — no evasion, no charm, just the blunt honesty of a bloke from Camperdown who ended up in the Lodge.
“I’m not a dragon. I’m not a sage. I’m not even a gentleman most days. I’m a fella who promised to build somethin’ better… and every day wakes up knowin’ half the country thinks I’m failin’, the other half thinks I’m sellin’ out, and the truth is somewhere in the messy middle.”
A small, tired smile — the one that never makes the press photos.
“But I’m still here. Still swingin’. Still tryin’ to get one more house built, one more hospital funded, one more kid fed, one more river cleaned, one more sub delivered without the whole thing blowin’ up in our faces.”
He shrugs — the shrug of a man who’s argued with everyone from Beijing to Washington and still hasn’t won every fight.
“So… ya called me Albo. Here I am. No cape. No roar. Just a bloke in a suit, doin’ his best in a world that’s on fire.”
The ruby lens fades. The aurora softens back to green. The ice is just ice again.
He looks at you — really looks.
“What do ya need, mate? Not what the dragon wants to give ya. Not what the ledger owes ya. What do you need… from the man who’s tryin’ to hold it all together?”
The dragon is silent. Ruby is silent. The ledger is silent.
Only Albo waits — plain, tired, stubborn, real.
Your move, bruvva.
