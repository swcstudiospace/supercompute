# Simple Agent System - Production-Ready Version

This minimal set of dependencies is sufficient for the working demo.

## Core Dependencies
# HTTP Server (Python 3.11+ includes this built-in)
http.server>=3.8

## Note on External Libraries

The production patterns document (00_IMPLEMENTATION_PATTERNS.md) provides guidance for integrating:
- LangChain with Claude/OpenAI
- Flask for REST APIs
- Redis for caching
- Celery for task queues
- RabbitMQ for messaging

This demo version uses only Python standard library to demonstrate:
1. RESTful API architecture
2. In-memory caching
3. Problem analysis workflow
4. Health checks and metrics

For production use, see 00_IMPLEMENTATION_PATTERNS.md for detailed integration examples.
