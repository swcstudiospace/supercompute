Zheng He’s Navigational Maps (Ming Dynasty Treasure Voyages – 1405–1433 – The Geometras’ Lost Legacy)
Zheng He’s seven grand voyages (1405–1433) under the Yongle and Xuande emperors produced what were likely the most advanced nautical charts of their time. Unfortunately, the original maps from the voyages have not survived — they were probably lost, destroyed, or hidden during the Ming court’s abrupt turn inward after 1433 (when the voyages were canceled and many records suppressed).
What we have today are later copies, reconstructions, and derivative works that preserve fragments of Zheng He’s navigational knowledge. The most important surviving source is the Mao Kun Map (茅坤圖), compiled around 1621 by Mao Yuanyi (grandson of Mao Kun), drawing on Zheng He-era materials.
1. The Mao Kun Map – The Closest Surviving Record
	•	Date: Compiled ~1621 (Wanli era), published in Wubei Zhi (Military Defense Records)
	•	Format: 20 double-page nautical charts + coastal profiles, covering from Nanjing to East Africa
	•	Scale: Approximate — distances in geng (watches) and li (≈0.5 km)
	•	Projection: Fan-shaped rhumb line charts — multiple compass roses with radiating rhumb lines (constant bearing courses) converging on key ports
	•	Content:
	◦	Rhumb lines (loxodromes) from departure to destination
	◦	Star altitudes (Polaris, Canopus, Southern Cross) for latitude fixes
	◦	Landmarks (mountains, rivers, islands) with names and sketches
	◦	Depth soundings (in zhang and chi)
	◦	Magnetic variation corrections (Ming compass used 24/32 directions)
Key Geometric Features:
	•	Rhumb line convergence — lines radiate from compass roses like spokes, showing constant bearing routes
	•	Latitude from Polaris — marked with star altitudes (e.g., “Polaris 8 fingers high” ≈ 8° latitude)
	•	Distance in geng — 1 geng ≈ 60 li ≈ 30 km at typical fleet speed (2.5–3 knots)
	•	Coastal profiles — silhouette views of land from sea, a geometric projection technique for recognition
2. Navigation Geometry Used by Zheng He’s Fleet
	•	Celestial triangle — Polaris altitude = latitude (Northern Hemisphere)
	◦	Canopus altitude for Southern Hemisphere
	◦	Cross-staff or quadrant for measurement
	◦	Correction for precession and refraction (Ming astronomers had tables)
	•	Rhumb line navigation — constant bearing sailing
	◦	Compass (luopan) with 24/32 divisions
	◦	Leeway correction for wind and current
	◦	Dead reckoning: speed × time × course → estimated longitude (inaccurate over long distances)
	•	Geometric triangulation — when land was sighted:
	◦	Measure angles to landmarks from ship
	◦	Use cross-staff for distance estimation
	◦	Plot position using plane table or rhumb chart
	•	Star charts & constellations — used Southern Cross, Canopus, and other stars for latitude
	◦	Ming navigators had star catalogs and altitude tables
3. Surviving Fragments & Reconstructions
	•	Mao Kun Map (1621) — the primary surviving source
	◦	Covers: Nanjing → Champa → Java → Malacca → Sri Lanka → India → Arabia → East Africa
	◦	Shows ports, reefs, currents, and star altitudes
	•	Zheng He Hanghai Tu (Zheng He Nautical Chart) — later copies exist in various collections
	•	Reconstructions — modern scholars (e.g., Joseph Needham, J.V.G. Mills) have reconstructed routes using Mao Kun data + historical records
4. Quantum / Modern Analogy
Zheng He’s navigation was non-local in practice:
	•	Star positions (celestial sphere) were “entangled” with ship location
	•	Rhumb lines were “superposed” possibilities until course correction collapsed them
	•	The fleet’s position was a wavefunction of possible locations — narrowed by each sighting
The Ming geometras measured the earth not with axioms, but with practical superposition — every star sight collapsed the uncertainty.
Want me to:
	•	Simulate Zheng He’s latitude fix from Polaris altitude?
	•	Reconstruct a rhumb line chart in code?
	•	Dive into Xu Guangqi’s Jesuit-influenced geometry (post-Zheng He)
	•	Compare Ming navigation geometry to European (Ptolemaic vs. rhumb)?
Just roar the next line.
The dragon’s compass is open. The grid is drawn. The measurement awaits.
