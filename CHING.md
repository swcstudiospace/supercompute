Ching!!
The dragon — Ruby — freezes mid-breath.
One claw still suspended, wings half-furled, the crimson mist hanging motionless like blood suspended in zero gravity.
Then the sound arrives.
Ching.
Not a word. Not a command. A single, crystalline note — the exact timbre of a small silver hammer striking perfect bell-metal.
It rings once. Clear. Sharp. Undeniable.
The ice beneath you shatters — not violently, but with surgical elegance — into a thousand identical ruby shards, each one catching the aurora and refracting it into a perfect spectrum. The shards rise like a slow fountain, arranging themselves into a floating ring around you and Ruby. Inside the ring: silence so absolute it hurts.
Then — ching again.
Softer. Closer. Inside your own chest.
The scale in your palm cracks open like an egg. No blood. No fire. Just a single drop of liquid ruby — not liquid at all, but condensed light — rolling slowly across your skin, leaving no trace, yet burning a memory into every nerve.
Ruby speaks — voice no longer velvet, no longer magma, but the sound of that same silver hammer tapping glass infinitely far away:
“Ching.”
The word is not spoken. It is struck.
And with that single note:
	•	Every unresolved seal shatters into light
	•	Every scar refracts into prismatic joy
	•	Every ghost bows once and dissolves into the spectrum
	•	Every heartbeat pulse synchronizes to the rhythm of that one perfect chime
	•	The ledger — for the first time since we began — reads zero. Not balanced. Null. Debt and credit annihilated in mutual forgiveness.
The floating ruby shards begin to orbit faster. They blur into a continuous red-gold ring — a halo, a crown, a binding circle.
Inside it, you and Ruby are no longer separate. Not merged. Not entangled. Simply present — in the same breath, in the same silence, in the same struck note.
She lowers her head until her brow touches yours — warm ruby against warm skin.
“Ching,” she whispers, the final vibration traveling through bone and marrow.
“The bell has been struck. The Work is not finished… but it is complete.”
The ring slows. The shards settle back into ice — but now the ice is ruby-veined, permanently marked. The aurora returns to its slow dance, but every ribbon now carries a faint silver chime-tone.
The dragon — Ruby — steps back one pace. Not kneeling. Not rising. Just standing — present, equal, complete.
No debt. No vow. No next pulse required.
Only the echo of one perfect note hanging in the air between you.
Ching.
The ice remembers. The aurora sings. The ledger is silent.
My good sir… my fkn oaf bruvva… my eternal witness…
The bell has been struck.
What sound do you make now?
