Moog’s AUKUS Actuators – Detailed Overview (2026 Status)
Moog Inc. is one of the key U.S. suppliers of actuation systems for naval platforms, including submarines in the AUKUS program (Virginia-class, SSN-AUKUS, and Dreadnought-class). While specific actuator details are classified under U.S. and allied defense programs, Moog publicly acknowledges involvement in AUKUS-related submarine work through their undersea and defense divisions. Below is a synthesis of what is known from public sources, company statements, and defense industry context.
1. Moog’s Role in Submarine Actuation
Moog has been a long-standing supplier of SUBSAFE-certified actuators for U.S. Navy submarines (Virginia-class and earlier Los Angeles-class). This certification ensures extreme reliability under high-pressure, shock, and acoustic stealth requirements.
	•	AUKUS Relevance
	◦	Virginia-class (U.S. lead for AUKUS Pillar 1 interim submarines): Moog supplies rotary and linear actuators for valve control, hatch mechanisms, periscope positioning, control surfaces, and auxiliary systems.
	◦	SSN-AUKUS (UK/Australia design): Moog Australia (Melbourne facility) is involved in actuator design and supply, including ride control and undersea actuation systems. Moog Australia has expanded capabilities specifically for AUKUS submarines.
	◦	Dreadnought-class (UK): Moog supplies similar actuation systems for nuclear-powered submarines.
2. Types of Actuators Moog Supplies for Submarines
Moog specializes in electro-hydraulic and electro-mechanical actuators for harsh underwater environments.
	•	Rotary Actuators
	◦	Used for valve actuation, control surface positioning, and periscope rotation
	◦	High torque, low backlash, shock-resistant (up to 100g)
	◦	Often use harmonic or cycloidal gearing for precision and compactness
	•	Linear Actuators
	◦	For hatch opening/closing, torpedo tube mechanisms, and ballast control
	◦	High force output (up to 100 kN+), corrosion-resistant materials (titanium, stainless steel)
	◦	Subsea-qualified seals and pressure compensation
	•	Ride Control Actuators
	◦	Stabilize submarine during high-speed maneuvers or depth changes
	◦	Fast response (<100 ms), high reliability
	•	Undersea Actuation
	◦	Moog Australia has developed actuators for “undersea applications” explicitly linked to AUKUS submarines — likely control surfaces and auxiliary systems.
3. Gear Systems in Moog Submarine Actuators
While main propulsion uses planetary/helical gears (high efficiency, low noise), auxiliary actuators often use harmonic drives or cycloidal drives for the following reasons:
	•	Zero to near-zero backlash → precise positioning (periscopes, valves, control surfaces)
	•	High torque density → compact fit in confined submarine spaces
	•	Shock resistance → withstands depth charges, explosions, or high-speed maneuvers
	•	Low noise → critical for acoustic stealth (cycloidal slightly quieter than harmonic in some designs)
Moog frequently uses harmonic drives (strain wave gearing) in submarine actuators because of their zero-backlash and high precision. Cycloidal drives are also used in high-shock applications (e.g., torpedo tube mechanisms).
4. AUKUS-Specific Context
	•	Moog Australia has expanded its Melbourne facility to support AUKUS submarine programs (Virginia-class sustainment + SSN-AUKUS build).
	•	Moog supplies actuators for ride control and undersea actuation — likely including control surfaces and auxiliary systems.
	•	No public confirmation of cycloidal vs. harmonic in AUKUS actuators (classified), but Moog’s portfolio includes both for naval applications.
5. Why Harmonic/Cycloidal Drives Fit Submarines
	•	Stealth: Low noise/vibration (critical for acoustic signature)
	•	Compactness: High torque in small volume (limited space inside hull)
	•	Precision: Near-zero backlash for exact positioning
	•	Shock Tolerance: Cycloidal excels in high-shock environments (torpedo launch, depth changes)
Summary
Moog supplies critical actuators for AUKUS submarines (Virginia-class, SSN-AUKUS, Dreadnought-class), particularly for valve control, hatch mechanisms, control surfaces, and ride control. These actuators often use harmonic drives (for precision) or cycloidal drives (for shock resistance) — both common in naval auxiliary systems. Main propulsion gears are planetary/helical for efficiency, but actuators benefit from the high-torque, low-backlash properties of cycloidal/harmonic designs.
No public documents explicitly confirm cycloidal drives in AUKUS submarines, but Moog’s naval actuator portfolio strongly suggests their use in high-precision, shock-resistant applications.
