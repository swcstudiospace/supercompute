Cycloidal Drives in AUKUS Submarines
From available sources, there is no publicly disclosed information directly confirming the use of cycloidal drives in AUKUS submarines (e.g., SSN-AUKUS, Virginia-class, or Dreadnought-class). 0 1 2 4 5 7 8 AUKUS submarine details are highly classified, particularly propulsion and actuator systems, so specific gear types are not revealed in open reports. 1 4 However, cycloidal drives (also called cycloidal reducers) are commonly used in submarine actuators for their compact size, high torque, low backlash, and shock resistance, which align with naval requirements. 2 Moog (a key AUKUS supplier) has experience with similar high-precision gearing in submarine actuators. 2 Below is an analysis based on submarine systems and cycloidal drive applications.
1. AUKUS Submarine Propulsion & Actuator Systems
AUKUS submarines are nuclear-powered (SSN) with conventionally armed weapons. Propulsion involves nuclear steam turbines, reduction gears, and propeller shafts. 4 8
	•	Main Propulsion Gears: Typically planetary or helical gears for high efficiency and low noise (stealth critical). Cycloidal drives are not standard for main propulsion due to slightly lower efficiency (85–95% vs. 95–99% for planetary) and higher vibration at high speeds. 3 
	•	Actuators & Auxiliary Systems: Cycloidal drives shine here. Moog Australia supplies actuators for AUKUS submarines (Collins, Virginia, Dreadnought-class), including ride control and undersea actuation. 2 Cycloidal designs provide compact torque multiplication for valves, hatches, periscopes, and torpedo systems. 2 
	•	AUKUS-Specific Relevance: SSN-AUKUS emphasizes stealth and maintainability. Cycloidal drives’ low backlash (0.5–3 arc-min) and high shock tolerance (300–500% rated torque) make them ideal for actuators in confined spaces with vibration/shock (e.g., during maneuvers or depth changes). 2 Moog’s undersea products are SUBSAFE-certified, and cycloidal-like mechanisms are used in silent, high-torque submarine applications. 2 
2. Cycloidal Drive Advantages in Submarines
Cycloidal drives excel in precision, compact applications: 9
	•	Noise Reduction: Fewer meshing parts → quieter operation, essential for acoustic stealth in AUKUS SSNs. 3 
	•	Shock Resistance: 300–500% rated torque → withstands torpedo launches or explosions.
	•	Compactness: High torque density (200–500 Nm/kg) → fits in tight hull spaces for valve/actuator control.
	•	Backlash: Near-zero (0.5–3 arc-min) → precise positioning for periscopes or control surfaces.
In AUKUS, cycloidal drives could be in auxiliary actuators (e.g., Moog’s systems for quiet valve actuation on Virginia-class). 2
3. Comparison to Other Gear Systems in Submarines
	•	Planetary Gears: Main propulsion (high efficiency, power transmission).
	•	Harmonic Drives: Similar to cycloidal for actuators (zero backlash, but lower shock tolerance).
	•	Cycloidal vs. Harmonic: Cycloidal has better shock resistance and efficiency, but slightly higher backlash — preferred for submarine actuators under load. 9 
No explicit cycloidal mentions in AUKUS docs, but they align with stealth and precision needs. 1 4 5
